Q1: before boost, there are always some requests dropped, (a lot actually), it is inevitable? e.g. arrival rate = 500, always ~10 timeout at the beginning, following requests are almost always successful
Q2: Master server maintains an ArrayBlockingQueue, when frontend: req = getNextRequest(), master.add_request(req);
before app tier server processRequest(), req_to_be_processed = master.get_request(), does this become a bottleneck?
Q3: How do we decide when and how many to scale out? CKPT2 still gives static load, but how do decide the # of each tiers according to that load
Q4:

frontend = 2, apptier = 1, c-500-369, {purchased=2, purchase_after_timeout=1, ok=5, timeout=51}
frontend = 2, apptier = 3, c-500-369, {purchased=27, ok=21, timeout=11}
frontend = 3, apptier = 3, c-500-369, {purchased=27, ok=20, timeout=12}
