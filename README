This is a distributed web server which emulated the behavior of cloud servers. The system contains 4 tiers, and is able to scale according to the current QPS.

The most important feature AWS EC2 ever provided is its load-balancing ability. It allows clusters to automatically scale up or scale down by adding/ killing instances.

Key word: Scalbility, System Hierarchy.

The main classes (Cloud, ServerLib, Database, ClientSim) and the sample
database file (db1.txt) are in the lib directory.  

A sample server is provided in the sample directory.  To build this, ensure
your CLASSPATH has the lib and sample directory included.  Then run make in 
the sample directory.  

To run the sample, try:
	java Cloud 15440 lib/db1.txt c-2000-1 12
This will launch the "Cloud" service, load the database with the items in 
lib/db1.txt, and start simulating clients arriving at a constant rate every
2000 ms.  A single instance of the sample Server will b erun as a "VM" 
(actually a spearate process).
